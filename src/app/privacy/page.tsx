          <p>
            <strong>From third parties:</strong>

            <li>Service metadata (for example, catalog IDs or territory availability) to resolve links.</li>

          <h3>3) How We Use Information</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service (for example, create or share MusicLinks, resolve conversions after recipient selection, show public profiles).</li>
            <li>Authenticate you and your connected services (OAuth), store or refresh tokens, and manage sessions.</li>
            <li>Prevent abuse, enforce policies, and secure the Service (rate limiting, fraud or malware detection, logging).</li>

            <li>Comply with law and respond to lawful requests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Legal bases (EEA/UK):</strong> performance of a contract (providing the Service), legitimate interests (site security, analytics, product improvement), consent (where required for cookies or marketing), and legal obligation.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>4) Sharing of Information</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Service providers or processors performing services on our behalf (hosting, database, authentication, analytics, email). Example categories include cloud infrastructure, database providers such as a managed Postgres service like Supabase, email delivery, analytics such as Google Analytics, and customer support tools.
            </li>
            <li>Streaming services when you connect accounts or a recipient chooses a destination service (to open content in that service).</li>
            <li>Legal and compliance recipients (to comply with law, enforce terms, protect rights).</li>
            <li>Parties to corporate transactions (merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets) subject to standard safeguards.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal information for money. Where analytics or advertising cookies or SDKs are used, certain U.S. state laws (such as the CPRA) may treat that as a "sale" or "sharing" for targeted advertising; see Your Privacy Choices below.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>5) Cookies and Analytics</h3>
          <p>We use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strictly necessary cookies (security, load balancing, session management).</li>
            <li>Preference cookies (for example, to remember a chosen destination service).</li>
            <li>Analytics (for example, Google Analytics) to understand usage and improve the Service.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can control cookies via browser settings and, where required by law, through our cookie banner or preferences manager. If disabled, some features may not work.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>6) Data Retention</h3>
          <p>We keep personal information for as long as needed to provide the Service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. Illustrative targets (adjust in practice):</p>

            <li>OAuth tokens: for the life of the connection; deleted or revoked upon disconnect or inactivity.</li>

          </ul>
          <p>We may retain limited records to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>7) Security</h3>
          <p>
            We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures (HTTPS or TLS, access controls, encryption in transit, periodic audits, optional two-factor authentication). No system is 100% secure. You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials.
